#pfis3

The updated, bug-fixed version of PFIS2. PFIS3 is an information-foraging-theory-based predictive model of programmer navigation. This project also contains additional single-factor predictive models based on TF-IDF.

Like PFIS2, PFIS3 relies on the PFIG plugin found in the pfis2 project to generate its predictions.

Note: Although many of the files here refer to the predictive model as PFIS2, this is actually our PFIS3 implementation. We just never bothered to rename PFIS2 to PFIS3 within the code.
